    "description": "This sweet potato pie is made very creamy with evaporated milk and gets a bit of a kick with rum. Along with sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, eggs and butter, all the ingredients are put into a food processor and blended until very smooth. Then the filling goes into a pie crust and bakes for less than an hour.",
