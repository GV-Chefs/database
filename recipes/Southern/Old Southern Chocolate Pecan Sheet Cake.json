    "description": "I received this recipe from an old Southern cook, a copy of a copy of a typed-up sheet from long ago, annotated with her notes (which included the word &#34;oleo&#34; instead of margarine). I've never seen another chocolate cake recipe like it. The result is a wonderfully rich, yet surprisingly light, chocolate sheet cake topped with a cooked chocolate and pecan frosting.",
