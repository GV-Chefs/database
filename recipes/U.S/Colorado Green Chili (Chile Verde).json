            "text": "After 20 minutes, transfer 2 cups of soup (without any pork pieces) to a blender. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to pur\u00e9e. Pur\u00e9e until smooth, then pour back into the cooking pot. This will create a thicker texture for your chili and will eliminate some of the chunky bits of chiles. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until pork is very tender, at least 35 minutes more."
