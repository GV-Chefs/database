Place the hot sausage and turkey into the skillet and cook until brown, chopping the meat up with a spoon into crumbles as it cooks, 10 to 15 more minutes. Spoon the meat mixture into a large slow cooker, leaving excess grease behind in the skillet. Stir the crushed tomatoes, Italian-style diced tomatoes, beer, garlic powder, kosher salt, black pepper, cumin, chili powder, paprika, and brown sugar into the meat mixture until thoroughly combined."
