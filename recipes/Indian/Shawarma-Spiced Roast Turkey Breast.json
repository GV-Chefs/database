    "description": "Chef John's roast turkey breast recipe uses the same spices people love in a chicken shawarma wrap. It is moist, tender, and extremely flavorful, and the spices seem to work even better with the meatier taste of turkey. The gorgeously-colored pan sauce made from the drippings elevates the flavor still more.",
