    "description": "How can a New Englander love Manhattan over New England clam chowder? Because I like to taste the clams, not just heavy cream with lumps. I came up with this recipe today using what I had on hand, but feel free to improvise. This tastes just like the chowder you get at the beach with clam cakes! Use a food chopper to minimize prep time.",
